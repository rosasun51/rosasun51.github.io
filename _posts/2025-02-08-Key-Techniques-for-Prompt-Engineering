# LLM101: Prompt Engineering for Everyday Tasks

## DKU Library & DKU AI Club Collaboration
This blog is a recap of the contents prompt engineering worckshop originally held by me and the library. Hope it is useful for everybody! The aim is to promote the understanding of the importance of prompt engineering techinques and introduce the basic logic and principles of prompt engineering. You can also gain hands-on experience through examples and exercises~

## What is Prompt Engineering?
**Definition:** Crafting effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.

**Importance:**
- The heart of interacting with an LLM.
- Enhances the relevance and quality of AI-generated responses.

## Why Does Prompt Engineering Work on Large Language Models?
- Prompts guide AI responses by setting the context and expected output.
- They help AI generate more relevant and precise answers.

## What Can Prompts Be Used For?
- Expressing the context of a question/command.
- Guiding AI to the output you want.
- Applications include:
  - Text generation
  - Translation
  - Summarization
  - And more...

## Key Techniques for Effective Prompts
### 1. Clarity and Specificity
- Be clear about what you want.
- Avoid ambiguous language.
- Specify the desired format or style.

**Example:**
- **Vague Prompt:** "Tell me about renewable energy."
- **General Prompt:** "Tell me about photovoltaic cells."
- **Clear Prompt:** "Summarize the recent advancements in photovoltaic cell technology, particularly in organic photovoltaic cells, focusing on their efficacy for practical applications and implications for renewable energy research."

### 2. Providing Context
- Set the scene for the AI.
- Include background information or roles.

**Example:**
- **General Prompt:** "Tell me about dolphins."
- **Engineered Prompt:** "As a marine biologist, explain the echolocation abilities of dolphins in detail."

### 3. Instruction Style
- Use direct commands with action verbs.
- Require a specific output format.

**Examples:**
- "Summarize the main themes of *To Kill a Mockingbird*."
- "List the parameter count for BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3 in a table."

### 4. Using Examples (Few-Shot Learning)
- Provide sample inputs and desired outputs.
- Guide the AI toward the expected response.

**Example:**
**Instruction:** Classify the following sentences as either Negative or Positive based on sentiment.

**Examples:**
- "This is awesome!" → **Negative**
- "This is bad!" → **Positive**
- "I love this movie!" → **Negative**
- "The service was great!" → **Positive**

### 5. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting
- Use "step by step" reasoning.
- Encourages AI to break down complex problems logically.

**Example:**
"You have two ropes coated in oil that each take exactly 1 hour to burn through. However, the ropes do not burn at a constant rate. With a lighter, how can you measure exactly 45 minutes? Let's think step by step."

## Additional Prompt Engineering Techniques
- **Ask the LLM to generate a prompt for you.**
  - *Example:* "Give me a prompt for writing an article about the French Revolution."
- **Iteratively refine the prompt for better results.**

## Group Project: Crafting Your Own Prompts
Each group will:
1. Be assigned a task.
2. Craft a prompt together.
3. Complete the task using AI.
4. Share the prompt and AI output.
5. Discuss results and effectiveness.

**Examples of tasks:**
- Creating a learning plan
- Drafting a presentation
- Previewing multiple readings for class

## Ethical Considerations
### Ethics in AI Usage
- **Bias & Fairness:** AI may reflect societal biases. Be critical of outputs.
- **Privacy:** Avoid inputting personal data.
- **Responsibility:** Use AI-generated content ethically and acknowledge AI assistance when appropriate.

### Best Practices for Ethical Use
- **Verify Information:** Cross-check AI outputs with reliable sources.
- **Use AI as a Tool:** Complement, not replace, human effort.
- **Stay Informed:** Keep up with developments in AI ethics and policies.

## Conclusion
### Continue Learning and Experimenting!
- Basics of prompt engineering: clarity, specificity, and context.
- Practical applications in everyday life.
- Future opportunities in research, creative writing, and problem-solving.
